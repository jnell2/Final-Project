Day 1:
10/31/2016
Overwhelmed with data, so I did research to try to find similar projects that have already been done.
No Githubs, but a few papers. Used very basic measure and ran models achieving a maximum accuracy around 60%.
Struggled through web scraping, found out I had to use selenium.
Finally got my first data table loaded into a pandas dataframe.

Day 2:
11/01/2016
Adjusted web-scraping code to get other data tables I needed.
All are loaded into pandas dataframes.
Trying to scrape nhl standings, but running into 2 issues:
1) website is same for all tabs, need to figure out how to have scraping code actually look at the "league" tab
2) the first column of the table has 3 elements, need to figure out how to get all 3 elements.

Day 3:
11/02/2016
Up until 1:00, was struggling with the nhl standings webpage trying to scrape the nhl standings.
Tried several different approaches, kept funning into issues.
Started looking at other sources where I could get the nhl standings.
Figured out that if I sort a table that I have already scraped in a certain way, I can get the standings.
(Table: Season Team Summary, Sort: points, wins, games played)
